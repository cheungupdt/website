# Robotic Arm Design

## Overview

Robotic arm design requires a deep understanding of mechanics, electronics, and software. My approach combines theoretical knowledge with practical experience to create optimized solutions for specific applications.

## Design Process

### 1. Requirements Analysis
- Payload capacity and reach requirements
- Working envelope analysis
- Speed and precision specifications
- Environmental considerations

### 2. Kinematic Design
- DH parameter optimization
- Joint configuration selection
- Workspace analysis
- Singularity avoidance

### 3. Dynamic Analysis
- Inertia calculations
- Torque requirements
- Vibration analysis
- Control system tuning
